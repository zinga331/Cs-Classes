It has long been considered one of the “Holy Grails” of Natural Language Processing, with the first research projects starting in the early 1950’s. Today, with the advent of neural MT (NMT), research, development, and production use of MT has skyrocketed. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon machine translate hundreds of billions of words every day. With the integration of neural speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology, applications of speech-to-speech MT, such as automatic video dubbing, have also exploded in just the past two years. A 2022 report on the growth of the MT industry shows that there are now over 45 provider companies of MT, furnishing MT between 125,000 unique language pairs. The Church is also now finally riding this wave of MT technology, fulfilling President Kimball’s prophetic vision of technology enabling the gospel to go to all the world. In his second century address, he specifically called out the importance of BYU’s participation in the development of computer-assisted translation.\n\n\nThis course will particularly target CS students fluent in 2 or more languages, including female and male RMs and ethnically diverse students.

The motivation for this change is that students need extra time practicing fundamental material (in labs and projects) so they can achieve mastery. The course includes 3 hours of lecture plus 2.5 hours of lab time. Students need sufficient extra hours for time to work on homework and projects, especially considering that debugging can take significant (and highly variable) time. A 4 credit course makes sufficient room for this practice time. A survey from the pilot we ran last year indicated that students spent a total of 12 hours per week on the class (including lecture and lab time).\n\n\nWe have surveyed top CS programs across the country – including Stanford, Berkeley, CMU, Princeton, and Washington – and nearly all use 4 credit courses in their early core. CS 111 is a true introduction to computer science (which we have previously lacked), including important topics such as functional programming, object-oriented programming, recursion, containers, trees, frames, ENBF, and interpreters. Students get a first exposure to concepts they will use (and get deeper exposure to) in CS 224, CS 235, and CS 236.\n\n\nIncreasing CS 111 to 4 credits will help students develop stronger fundamentals. This will allow more students to confidently take 2 or 3 CS courses at a time (as needed by the major) and thus graduate more quickly than they otherwise would. We also believe this may help reduce the failure rate in subsequent CS courses. We have found that the failing students tend to lack the fundamentals they need to succeed in the major, with some often repeating courses several times to try to make it through.\n\n\nAffected departments have been working to adjust to this change over the past year and are either adjusting their majors or will be asking the university to accommodate a 1-credit increase in credits for their program. Programs that previously used only CS 142 as a requirement can substitute “CS 110 or CS 111” without any change in credits, since CS 110 is a 3-credit course. Programs that previously required both CS 142 and CS 235 can substitute CS 111 for CS 142 in their requirements.\n\n\nThe CS department advises students who have no prior programming experience to take CS 110 before CS 111. We work closely with students so that they can transfer from CS 111 down to CS 110 early in the semester if needed. We are planning to create a non-graded assessment that prospective CS 111 students can take to determine if they are ready for the course.\n\n\nThis course is also required by Bioinformatics, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics (including ACME), and Physics (and Astronomy and Applied Physics). It is an option and an elective in various other programs.\n\n\nPlease note, this course is required in the new HCI emphasis but we don't have a program code for it yet.","9fzcu":"Required"},

As the animation curriculum has grown it has become prudent to isolate a class where we can teach knowledge specific to shot design and animated film structure. Here are our primary justifications.\n\n\n1) All disciplines of animation connect to storytelling through how their work is presented in camera. As such, all need a practical understanding of story, cinematography, layout and shot design.\n\n\n2) In the past we have paired this material with Storyboarding instruction. By separating the teaching of visual narrative from the drawing and performance skills specific to Storyboarding, we will improve the ability of students to absorb material that is critical to their success. A small number of our students go on to work as storyboard artists, while a much larger number still require these skills in daily production.\n\n\n3) By introducing the class early on we will create a stronger sequence of instruction. Foundational narrative skills taught here will improve specific skill classes such as Storyboarding(DESAN 260), Visual Development (DESAN 361R) and Previsualization (CSANM 353). All aspects of shot production will benefit from a stronger understanding of visual story. Storyboarding (DESAN 260) and Previsualization (CSANM 353) classes will be able to focus on studio practices instead of foundational instruction. For more Design oriented students an understanding of the material will inform them how to design props and spaces for use in a shot based environment.\n\n\n4) The separation of film structure and design from the mechanics of drafting and storyboarding make this class an excellent way for CS Animation Emphasis students to learn the necessary story & editing skills to be successful artists. In the past our CS students have had to pick up these skills during capstone classes. We would like for them to have an elective option to learn them earlier in the program.\n\n\nThis course will be required in the Animation BFA and an elective in the CS:Animation and Games emphasis.","9fzcu":"Both"},{"code":"C S 483","courseDependents":[],"courseGroupId":"13944-000","courseNumber":"483","courseTypicallyOffered":"Winter","credits":{"creditHours":{"value":3},"lectureHours":{"value":3},"labHours":{"value":0}},"description":"Culminating experience based on skills learned in advanced technical courses.

This is based on feedback from our employer advisory board that web applications are of primary importance and mobile applications have secondary importance.\n\n\nAs we are making this change to CS 240 we are also updating its title, learning objectives, and prerequisites.\n\n\nThe title better reflects the content -- software construction. The learning objectives have long been out of date and we are updating them to reflect the content of the course.\n\n\nWe are changing the prerequisite to CS 235 (eliminating CS 236) to better reflect the preparation we expect from students entering the course. Previously we relied on CS 236 to give students additional experience with object-oriented programming. However, this creates a long prerequisite chain, and the discrete math content in CS 236 is not required for CS 240. With the introduction of CS 111, we believe students will be better prepared coming out of CS 235 than they were in the past. In addition, making this change will provide students with more flexibility as they take our major or minor, and will better serve the programs that require CS 240 by removing a prerequisite that is not needed. This may be particularly helpful for students majoring in Bioinformatics. This also enables CS 236 to adapt independently of CS 240 in the future and allows us to be more flexible with the CS minor in the future.\n\n\nThe instructors will be managing the course carefully to ensure that students are able to succeed. They will also be communicating with the instructors of CS 111 and CS 235 to be sure students are adequately prepared.\n\n\nFrom a content perspective, we will be eliminating most of the front-end/Android material to make room for deeper coverage of software engineering concepts and principles while keeping the course accessible to other departments that rely on it.\n\n\nPlease note, this course is required in the new HCI emphasis but we don't have a program code for it yet.","9fzcu":"Required","awavi":[{"name":"Biology CS letter.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/lErw06qShJFt.pdf"},{"name":"statistics-cs-support.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616758/0DAEDzsbvQ5Y.pdf"},{"name":"math-cs-support.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/Ooo3TLimKOOF.pdf"},{"name":"ecen-support-CS240.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/maeJqYOO0TKc.pdf"},{"name":"biology-240-support.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/DBAmg4HIKqDT.pdf"},{"name":"CS 240 Course Proposal.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/qVWqMc23iymS.pdf"},{"name":"physics-cs-support.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/I2XFf9TyiF4q.pdf"}]},{"code":"CSANM 452","courseDependents":[],"courseGroupId":"10992-003","courseNumber":"452","courseTypicallyOffered":"Winter","credits":{"creditHours":{"value":3},"lectureHours":{"value":3},"labHours":{"value":3}},"description":"Portfolio development based on advanced animation/design projects.
