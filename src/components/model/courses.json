This is based on feedback from our employer advisory board that web applications are of primary importance and mobile applications have secondary importance.\n\n\nAs we are making this change to CS 240 we are also updating its title, learning objectives, and prerequisites.\n\n\nThe title better reflects the content -- software construction. The learning objectives have long been out of date and we are updating them to reflect the content of the course.\n\n\nWe are changing the prerequisite to CS 235 (eliminating CS 236) to better reflect the preparation we expect from students entering the course. Previously we relied on CS 236 to give students additional experience with object-oriented programming. However, this creates a long prerequisite chain, and the discrete math content in CS 236 is not required for CS 240. With the introduction of CS 111, we believe students will be better prepared coming out of CS 235 than they were in the past. In addition, making this change will provide students with more flexibility as they take our major or minor, and will better serve the programs that require CS 240 by removing a prerequisite that is not needed. This may be particularly helpful for students majoring in Bioinformatics. This also enables CS 236 to adapt independently of CS 240 in the future and allows us to be more flexible with the CS minor in the future.\n\n\nThe instructors will be managing the course carefully to ensure that students are able to succeed. They will also be communicating with the instructors of CS 111 and CS 235 to be sure students are adequately prepared.\n\n\nFrom a content perspective, we will be eliminating most of the front-end/Android material to make room for deeper coverage of software engineering concepts and principles while keeping the course accessible to other departments that rely on it.\n\n\nPlease note, this course is required in the new HCI emphasis but we don't have a program code for it yet.","9fzcu":"Required","awavi":[{"name":"Biology CS letter.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/lErw06qShJFt.pdf"},{"name":"statistics-cs-support.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616758/0DAEDzsbvQ5Y.pdf"},{"name":"math-cs-support.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/Ooo3TLimKOOF.pdf"},{"name":"ecen-support-CS240.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/maeJqYOO0TKc.pdf"},{"name":"biology-240-support.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/DBAmg4HIKqDT.pdf"},{"name":"CS 240 Course Proposal.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/qVWqMc23iymS.pdf"},{"name":"physics-cs-support.pdf","path":"files/form/1677514616761/I2XFf9TyiF4q.pdf"}]},{"code":"STAT 121","courseDependents":[[{"_id":"ls8HFSQ6VAkUehhhJhOpHw==","condition":"courses","courseDependencyId":"05604-032","courseId":"01526-002","requisiteName":"Prerequisites","requisiteType":"Prerequisite","showInCatalog":true,"type":"requisites","name":"Intro Artificial Intelligence","code":"C S 470","subjectCode":"C S","courseNumber":"470","longName":"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence","courseGroupId":"01526-002"},{"_id":"usDxFTV6O2XeNQII/dsRnA==","condition":"courses","courseDependencyId":"05604-032","courseId":"10322-004","requisiteName":"Prerequisites","requisiteType":"Prerequisite","showInCatalog":true,"type":"requisites","name":"Intro to Machine Learning","code":"C S 472","subjectCode":"C S","courseNumber":"472","longName":"Introduction to Machine Learning","courseGroupId":"10322-004"},{"_id":"MQZw7AIj0az/9eslZw/atA==","condition":"courses","courseDependencyId":"05604-032","courseId":"11612-002","requisiteName":"Prerequisites","requisiteType":"Prerequisite","showInCatalog":true,"type":"requisites","name":"Concrete, Masonry, & Asphalt","code":"CCE 306","subjectCode":"CCE","courseNumber":"306","longName":"Civil Engineering Materials: Concrete, Masonry, and Asphalt","courseGroupId":"11612-002"},{"_id":"A6GPVQxS5/wo0+Vpm3qzVQ==","condition":"courses","courseDependencyId":"05604-032","courseId":"00724-006","requisiteName":"Prerequisites","requisiteType":"Prerequisite","showInCatalog":true,"type":"requisites","name":"Concrete, Masonry, and Asphalt","code":"CFM 305","subjectCode":"CFM","courseNumber":"305","longName":"Concrete, Masonry, and Asphalt Methods","courseGroupId":"00724-006"},{"_id":"++MXz8+9ZkjI3juXPgTYMg==","condition":"courses","courseDependencyId":"05604-032","courseId":"13917-000","requisiteName":"Prerequisites","requisiteType":"Prerequisite","showInCatalog":true,"type":"requisites","name":"Res.

The motivation for this change is that students need extra time practicing fundamental material (in labs and projects) so they can achieve mastery. The course includes 3 hours of lecture plus 2.5 hours of lab time. Students need sufficient extra hours for time to work on homework and projects, especially considering that debugging can take significant (and highly variable) time. A 4 credit course makes sufficient room for this practice time. A survey from the pilot we ran last year indicated that students spent a total of 12 hours per week on the class (including lecture and lab time).\n\n\nWe have surveyed top CS programs across the country – including Stanford, Berkeley, CMU, Princeton, and Washington – and nearly all use 4 credit courses in their early core. CS 111 is a true introduction to computer science (which we have previously lacked), including important topics such as functional programming, object-oriented programming, recursion, containers, trees, frames, ENBF, and interpreters. Students get a first exposure to concepts they will use (and get deeper exposure to) in CS 224, CS 235, and CS 236.\n\n\nIncreasing CS 111 to 4 credits will help students develop stronger fundamentals. This will allow more students to confidently take 2 or 3 CS courses at a time (as needed by the major) and thus graduate more quickly than they otherwise would. We also believe this may help reduce the failure rate in subsequent CS courses. We have found that the failing students tend to lack the fundamentals they need to succeed in the major, with some often repeating courses several times to try to make it through.\n\n\nAffected departments have been working to adjust to this change over the past year and are either adjusting their majors or will be asking the university to accommodate a 1-credit increase in credits for their program. Programs that previously used only CS 142 as a requirement can substitute “CS 110 or CS 111” without any change in credits, since CS 110 is a 3-credit course. Programs that previously required both CS 142 and CS 235 can substitute CS 111 for CS 142 in their requirements.\n\n\nThe CS department advises students who have no prior programming experience to take CS 110 before CS 111. We work closely with students so that they can transfer from CS 111 down to CS 110 early in the semester if needed. We are planning to create a non-graded assessment that prospective CS 111 students can take to determine if they are ready for the course.\n\n\nThis course is also required by Bioinformatics, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics (including ACME), and Physics (and Astronomy and Applied Physics). It is an option and an elective in various other programs.\n\n\nPlease note, this course is required in the new HCI emphasis but we don't have a program code for it yet.","9fzcu":"Required"},{"code":"C S 428","courseDependents":[],"courseGroupId":"01512-003","courseNumber":"428","courseTypicallyOffered":"Contact Department","credits":{"creditHours":{"value":3},"lectureHours":{"value":3},"labHours":{"value":0}},"description":"Analysis, design, implementation, and testing of significant software systems.","id":"01512-003","learningOutcomes":[{"name":"Group Dynamics","objective":"Demonstrate the ability to work in a group on a significant project","tags":["204321","1"],"activity":"","assessment":"","justification":""},{"name":"Software Engineering Fundamentals","objective":"Demonstrate practices that result in quality software","tags":["204322","2"],"activity":"","assessment":"","justification":""},{"name":"Software Ethics","objective":"Demonstrate an understanding of how ethics impact software development","tags":["204323","3"],"activity":"","assessment":"","justification":""}],"longName":"Software Engineering","name":"Software Engineering","programDependents":[],"requisites":{"requisitesSimple":[{"name":"Prerequisites","type":"Prerequisite","showInCatalog":true,"rules":[{"condition":"completedAllOf","value":{"condition":"courses","values":[{"logic":"and","value":["11440-001"]}],"subSelections":[]},"name":"Prerequisites","id":"o5yIAYvtELCBalW37xmd"}],"id":"j1MxRVGoDNeWHD0f9t3a","sisId":""}]},"subjectCode":"C S","curriculumId":"01512","titleCode":"003","courseType":"C - Combined Lecture and Activity"},{"code":"C S 412","courseDependents":[],"courseGroupId":"11187-001","courseNumber":"412","courseTypicallyOffered":"Contact Department","credits":{"creditHours":{"value":3},"lectureHours":{"value":3},"labHours":{"value":0}},"description":"Optimization, problem formulation, and solution algorithms, including simplex and interior point methods.

It has long been considered one of the “Holy Grails” of Natural Language Processing, with the first research projects starting in the early 1950’s. Today, with the advent of neural MT (NMT), research, development, and production use of MT has skyrocketed. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon machine translate hundreds of billions of words every day. With the integration of neural speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology, applications of speech-to-speech MT, such as automatic video dubbing, have also exploded in just the past two years. A 2022 report on the growth of the MT industry shows that there are now over 45 provider companies of MT, furnishing MT between 125,000 unique language pairs. The Church is also now finally riding this wave of MT technology, fulfilling President Kimball’s prophetic vision of technology enabling the gospel to go to all the world. In his second century address, he specifically called out the importance of BYU’s participation in the development of computer-assisted translation.\n\n\nThis course will particularly target CS students fluent in 2 or more languages, including female and male RMs and ethnically diverse students. It prepares students for advanced work in this field, whether in MS or PhD programs, or in the increasingly plentiful industry R&D job openings. Steve Richardson has taught this course 3 times with 8, 10, and 6 students, respectively - the lower number apparently resulting from the switch to fall semester from last winter semester.\n\n\nPlease note, this course is an elective in the new HCI emphasis but we don't have a program code for it yet.","9fzcu":"Elective","awavi":[{"name":"CS 479 Course Proposal.pdf","path":"files/form/1677517122014/P7lFe0zAT8Ca.pdf"}]},{"code":"C S 494","courseDependents":[],"courseGroupId":"13422-000","courseNumber":"494","courseTypicallyOffered":"Fall","credits":{"creditHours":{"value":3},"lectureHours":{"value":3},"labHours":{"value":0}},"description":"Culminating experience based on skills learned in advanced technical courses.

We are in the middle stages of this process. Currently we are proposing to adjust the prerequisites of some courses in the core to provide more flexibility for students.\n\n\nAs part of this change, we are modifying the prerequisite for CS 312 from CS 240 to (CS 236 and CS 260) or (CS 236 and CS 224) or (Math 290 and CS 235).\n\n\nCS 312 has traditionally relied on material in CS 236, which has been transitively required by having a prerequisite of CS 240. Dropping CS 236 as a prerequisite for CS 240 requires us to change the prerequisite for CS 312 to list CS 236 rather than CS 240.\n\n\nWhile we are making this change we re-assessed what material students need prior to CS 330. We found that they need (1) experience with discrete math or mathematical reasoning (CS 236 or Math 290) and (2) experience programming in more than one language. We feel the set of prerequisite options listed above will cover those two needs.\n\n\nSee the CS program proposal for details on how our prerequisite changes, collectively, will help reduce student time to graduation, while providing more flexibility for students in our major and in other majors as they explore Computer Science.\n\n\nPlease note, this course is an elective in the new HCI emphasis but we don't have a program code for it yet.","9fzcu":"Elective"},{"code":"C S 393","courseDependents":[],"courseGroupId":"14034-000","courseNumber":"393","courseTypicallyOffered":"Fall and Winter","credits":{"creditHours":{"value":3},"lectureHours":{"value":3},"labHours":{"value":0}},"description":"This course will help students to become better at problem solving, increasing their ability to excel at technical/coding interviews (a challenging part of the hiring/interviewing process).
